# PaliGemma2 LitServe

[![Open In Studio](https://pl-bolts-doc-images.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/app-2/studio-badge.svg)](https://lightning.ai/sitammeur/studios/paligemma2-litserve)

[PaliGemma 2](https://huggingface.co/collections/google/paligemma-2-release-67500e1e1dbfdd4dee27ba48) is an updated vision-language model that leverages **Gemma 2** and **SigLIP** for superior performance on various vision-language tasks. It processes images and text to generate multilingual text outputs. This project shows how to create a self-hosted, private API that deploys a PaliGemma 2 [vision language model](https://huggingface.co/google/paligemma2-3b-ft-docci-448) with LitServe, an easy-to-use, flexible serving engine for AI models built on FastAPI.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `server.py`: The file containing the main code for the web server.
- `client.py`: The file containing the code for client-side requests.
- `LICENSE`: The license file for the project.
- `README.md`: The README file that contains information about the project.
- `assets`: The folder containing screenshots for working on the application.
- `images`: The folder containing images for testing purposes.
- `.env.example`: The example file for environment variables.
- `.gitignore`: The file containing the list of files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Tech Stack

- Python (for the programming language)
- PyTorch (for the deep learning framework)
- Hugging Face Transformers Library (for the model)
- LitServe (for the serving engine)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Run the server: `python server.py`
2. Upon running the server successfully, you will see uvicorn running on port 8000.
3. Open a new terminal window.
4. Run the client: `python client.py`

Now, you can see the model's output based on the input request. The model will generate captions in the selected language for the images provided in the `images` folder.

**Note**: You need a Hugging Face access token to run the application. You can get the token by signing up on the Hugging Face website and creating a new token from the settings page. After getting the token, you can set it as an environment variable `ACCESS_TOKEN` in your system by creating a `.env` file in the project's root directory. Check the `.env.example` file for reference.

## Usage

The project can be used to serve the PaliGemma 2 family of models using LitServe. It particularly allows you to input an image and select a language to generate a caption, suggesting potential use cases in semantic tagging, visual question answering, and more.
